<!--
    Each possible command line option is represented by an <option>.  Each
    of those must have three attributes: name, arg, and help.

       name - The name of the command line option
       arg  - What kind of argument the option has and what to do with it
       help - Help text for the option

    Valid values for arg are:

       file    - File name.  The file must exist.
       dir     - Directory name.  If the directory exists, it must be empty.
       string  - Unparsed string
       integer - Integer
       kvp     - Key Value pair, 
       none    - No argument, just a boolean flag

    Appending an "s" to file, string, or integer means more than one
    of this option may appear and each subsequent option is added to
    an internal array.  kvp args get stored to an internal hash.

    Beware: this isn't currently validated but probably will be at
    some point, so get it right.
