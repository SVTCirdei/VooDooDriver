This is the VDD latency test suite.

The purpose of this suite is to synthetically stress VDD using a
variety of techniques for simulating operation in a high-latency
environment.

In order to use, set up a web server to allow access to this
directory.  With apache, this directive works:

    <Alias "/latency/" "</path/to/latency/>">
    <Directory "</path/to/latency/>">
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script pl
    </Directory>

Then, run VDD using the provided test scripts (the XML files).
